# Weather-App

A simple but gorgeous weather app (designed in HTML/CSS for the front-end and vanilla Javascript as the back-end logic) that  
implements the open weather API (third-party API) to gather weather data via queries by the user and then displays the
current weather and a 5-day forecast on a local server via the browser. 

If the user enters a zip code the weather, forecast, and wind-speed  will be shown in Imperial units instead of Metric units. 

The app also includes a city search suggestions mechanism when a query is performed.

Below are screenshots of the app that shows what it looks like and how it functions:
