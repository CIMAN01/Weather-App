# Weather-App

A simple but gorgeous weather app (designed in HTML/CSS for the front-end and vanilla Javascript as the back-end logic) that  
implements the open weather API (third-party API) to gather weather data via queries by the user and then displays the
current weather and a 5-day forecast on a local server via the browser. If the user enters a zip code the weather/forecast 
will be shown in Fahrenheit instead of Celsius. The app also includes a city search suggestions mechanism when a query is performed.

And now a search button has also been added.
